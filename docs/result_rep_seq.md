# result_rep_seq.fasta.xz

It is a fasta xzipped file containing the representative
protein sequences for each OPU assigned. Their names are
ordinal, and can be retrieved by using the respective
association name file generated in the results folder.

**NOTE:** Each input pair of files will have a rename.tsv file in
the results folder. With it, you can cross info with representatives
and the file of association of proteins and their representative.

This fasta file is for reference and potential reclustering with
larger inputs.

**Example:**

```

MAQERKDRGFYSKYYREIDVVHGLQTKP[...]EETSPCAVANNISPEEARLTIEKNYAAR
