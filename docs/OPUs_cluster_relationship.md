# OPUs_cluster_relationship.tsv.xz

During the clustering process, each protein is associated to one of its
representatives. This tab separated xzipped table contains the association
between the renamed proteins and their representative sequence inside the
OPUs they were assigned to.

The columns are:

| **name** | **description** |
| :---: | :---: |
| representative | Ordinal accession of the protein assigned as OPU representative |
| sequence | Ordinal accession of the protein assigned to a given OPU representative |

**Example:**

```
